bruteforce-salted-openssl
=========================

The purpose of this program is to try to decrypt a file that was encrypted
with the 'openssl' command (e.g.: openssl enc -aes256 -salt -in clear.file
 -out encrypted.file).

The program tries to decrypt the file by trying all the possible passwords.
The minimum and maximum password length to try can be indicated as option
on the command line.
There are also options to indicate the cipher, digest, character set and
number of threads to use.

The program should be able to use all the digests and symmetric ciphers
available with the OpenSSL libraries installed on your system.


## Dependencies

The program requires the OpenSSL libraries.


## Limitations

The program considers decrypted data as correct if it is mainly composed of
printable ASCII characters (at least 90%).
If the file you want to decrypt doesn't contain plain text, you will have
to modify the 'valid_data' function in the source code to match your needs.


## Examples

Try to decrypt a aes256 encrypted file using 4 threads, trying
only passwords with 5 characters:

    bruteforce-salted-openssl -t 4 -l 5 -m 5 -c aes256 encrypted.file


Show the list of available algorithms:

    bruteforce-salted-openssl -a


If the program finds a candidate password 'pwd', you can decrypt the data
using the 'openssl' command:

    openssl enc -d -aes256 -salt -in encrypted.file -out decrypted.file -k pwd
